## 📜 Overview  

- **Language:** Solidity (`^0.8.24`)  
- **Network:** zkSync Sepolia Testnet  
- **Purpose:** A **secure and transparent voting system** with delegation support.

## ⚡ Key Features  

✔ **Decentralized Voting** – No central authority, all votes are **immutable** on the blockchain.  
✔ **Delegate Voting Rights** – Voters can **transfer their votes** to trusted delegates.  
✔ **Fair & Transparent Counting** – Every vote is recorded and publicly verifiable.  
✔ **Prevents Double Voting** – A voter **cannot** cast multiple votes.  
✔ **Optimized for zkSync** – Low gas fees and fast execution for **Layer 2** transactions.  
✔ **Instant Results** – The contract **automatically tracks** the leading proposal.

## 🔍 Security Considerations  

- **No Double Voting**: Ensures each voter **can vote only once**.  
- **Prevents Delegation Loops**: Protects against **infinite delegation cycles**.  
- **Transparent & Immutable**: Voting data **cannot be tampered with**.  
- **Optimized Gas Usage**: Designed to be **cost-efficient** on zkSync.
